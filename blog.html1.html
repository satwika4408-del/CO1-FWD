    <h1>PAGES OF MY LIFE</h1>
	<h2>A NEW BEGINNING </h2>
	<p style="color:red;"> Pages of My Life is a collection of moments, thoughts, and experiences that shape who I am. Each page holds a memory, whether it is filled with joy, learning, mistakes, or growth. Through these pages, I express my feelings, dreams, and everyday reflections in a simple and honest way.  </p>
