    <h1>CREDITSCORE CALCULATOR</h1>
	<h2>CREDIT SCORE EVALUATION MODULE</h2>
	<p> The Credit Score Calculator Project is designed to evaluate an individual’s creditworthiness based on key financial parameters such as income, existing debts, repayment history, and debt-to-income ratio. The system processes user-provided data and applies predefined rules to calculate a credit score accurately. Based on the calculated score, users are categorized into different risk levels such as excellent, good, fair, or poor. This project helps users understand their financial standing and assists financial institutions in making informed lending decisions. The application demonstrates the practical use of programming concepts, logical decision-making, and real-world financial analysis.</p>
